Last call detection might be useful for menus, e.g.

Home | Blog | Contact | About

The bits in the middle are seperators that need to be generated but from a call like:

  menu {
    link "Home"
    link "Blog"
    link "Contact"
    link "About"
  }

Might be used in a macro like:
  macro link with s : string {
    // Output a seperator
    if (!last) {
      node span "|"
    }
    node span s
  }
  
Alternatively, a between syntax might be neat:

  between link {
    node span s
  }

With new between tracking in each view ? or customisable reset
  between link reset on div {
    node span s
  }
  
  div {
    link "a"
    link "b"
    link "c"
  }
  div {
    link "d"
    link "e"
  }
  
Might result in:
  a | b | c     d | e
